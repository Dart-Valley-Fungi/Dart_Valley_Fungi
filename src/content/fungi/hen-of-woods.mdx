## About Hen of the Woods

Hen of the Woods is a mushroom variety that traditionally grows wild in clusters at the base of trees. These magnificent specimens are grown by Dart Valley Fungi, just over the hill from our farm in Devon, so that non-foraging experts can experience their outstanding flavour! Earthy, sweet, and distinctly truffle-like... In the words of our farm chef, 'they're bloody good.'

## Growing at Dart Valley

These mushrooms are grown completely peat-free, using an organic substrate block made from sawdust and rye. Peatlands are vital carbon stores and wildlife habitats, so by keeping peat in the ground, we're helping protect nature and fight climate change - one mushroom at a time.

## How to Prepare

Hen of the Woods mushrooms are best cooked and served simply, to allow their excellent texture and truffle-like flavour to speak for themselves. Slice and pan fry, then serve on toast or use to finish a pasta or risotto.

## Storage

Keep in the fridge and eat within a few days.
